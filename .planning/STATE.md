# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-01)

**Core value:** When a developer passes a struct and data to a CLI agent, they get validated typed output back reliably — the agent is forced through MCP tool constraints to submit conforming JSON rather than freeform text.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Force structured output via MCP tools rather than prompt-only (gives schema enforcement at protocol level)
- Three-tool pattern (submit/validate/example) for workflow guidance
- Adapter-per-CLI crate structure (clean separation of concerns)
- Best-effort containment per CLI (document limitations rather than refuse to support)
- Deprioritize OpenCode for v1.0 (focus on getting two adapters rock solid)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns
