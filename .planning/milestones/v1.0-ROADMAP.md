# Milestone v1.0: Production Release

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-02-03
**Phases:** 01-11 (including 02.1 decimal insertion)
**Total Plans:** 40

## Overview

This roadmap transformed rig-cli from functional prototype to production-ready library. The journey spanned 12 phases, starting with critical resource management fixes (bounded channels, task cleanup, zombie prevention) that prevent OOM kills and resource exhaustion. We then layered in the retry-with-validation loop that enables self-correcting structured extraction, followed by agent containment, observability, and platform hardening. The final phases polished the Rig integration and hardened all three adapters (Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode) to production quality, then delivered comprehensive documentation. Each phase built on stable foundations to deliver a CLI-agent provider that feels native to the Rig ecosystem.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Resource Management Foundation

**Goal:** Subprocess execution is stable with bounded resources and no leaks
**Depends on:** Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements:** RSRC-01, RSRC-02, RSRC-03, RSRC-04, RSRC-05
**Plans:** 5 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Rewrite claudecode-adapter with bounded channels, JoinSet, graceful shutdown, rich errors
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Rewrite codex-adapter with bounded channels, JoinSet, graceful shutdown, rich errors
- [x] 01-03-PLAN.md — Rewrite opencode-adapter with bounded channels, JoinSet, graceful shutdown, rich errors
- [x] 01-04-PLAN.md — Update rig-provider callers to bounded channels, workspace-wide RSRC verification
- [x] 01-05-PLAN.md — Fix graceful_shutdown in codex/opencode: proper error returns, child reaping, no zombies

**Details:**
Success Criteria:
1. All stdout/stderr streams use bounded channels with configurable backpressure (no OOM from unbounded queues)
2. All spawned tokio tasks are tracked via JoinHandles and properly aborted/awaited on timeout
3. Subprocesses are killed and awaited without leaving zombie processes
4. Stream readers fully drain before process exit (no data loss from race conditions)
5. All error paths propagate errors instead of panicking (no .expect() or .unwrap() in stream handling)

---

### Phase 2: Retry & Validation Loop

**Goal:** Agent self-corrects on validation errors through bounded retry attempts
**Depends on:** Phase 1
**Requirements:** EXTR-01, EXTR-04
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Foundation types: ExtractionError, ExtractionMetrics, AttemptRecord, ExtractionConfig, validation feedback builder
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — ExtractionOrchestrator retry loop, enhanced ValidateJsonTool feedback, module wiring

**Details:**
Success Criteria:
1. When agent submits invalid JSON, validation errors are fed back with specific field-level feedback
2. Retry loop attempts up to configurable max (default 3) with immediate retry
3. Token cost or attempt count is tracked per extraction
4. Retry loop terminates after max attempts with clear failure indication

---

### Phase 2.1: Transparent MCP Tool Agent (INSERTED)

**Goal:** User provides ToolSet + prompt, system handles all MCP plumbing transparently — no manual config, no dual-mode boilerplate, no RunConfig construction
**Depends on:** Phase 2
**Requirements:** Core value — agent forced through MCP tool constraints to submit conforming JSON
**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02.1-01-PLAN.md — Add MCP config fields to Codex and OpenCode adapters
- [x] 02.1-02-PLAN.md — McpToolAgent builder, CliAdapter enum, and config generation
- [x] 02.1-03-PLAN.md — Simplified mcp_tool_agent_e2e example and workspace verification

**Details:**
Success Criteria:
1. McpToolAgent builder accepts a ToolSet and prompt, auto-spawns the current binary as MCP server via env var detection
2. MCP config JSON is auto-generated with correct server name, tool names, and env vars
3. Tool names are auto-computed as `mcp__<server_name>__<tool_name>` from ToolSet definitions
4. Claude CLI is discovered and launched with correct --mcp-config, --allowed-tools flags
5. Temp files are auto-cleaned via RAII guards
6. Existing mcp_extraction_e2e example reduces from ~300 lines to ~50 lines using new API

---

### Phase 3: Payload & Instruction System

**Goal:** Developer can pass context data to agents and force tool workflow
**Depends on:** Phase 2.1
**Requirements:** EXTR-02, EXTR-03, EXTR-05
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — Builder extensions (.payload(), .instruction_template()) and enhanced prompt construction with workflow enforcement
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md — Payload extraction E2E example and workspace verification

**Details:**
Success Criteria:
1. Developer can attach file contents or text blobs to extraction request
2. Built-in instruction template forces agents to use example → validate → submit workflow
3. Agents cannot respond with freeform text instead of tool calls
4. Three-tool pattern (example/validate/submit) is the enforced extraction mechanism

---

### Phase 4: Agent Containment

**Goal:** Agents are locked to MCP tools only, no builtin tool escape
**Depends on:** Phase 3
**Requirements:** CONT-01, CONT-02, CONT-03, CONT-04
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md — Containment-first defaults and opt-in escape hatches on McpToolAgentBuilder
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md — CLI flag audit tests for Claude Code and Codex containment flags

**Details:**
Success Criteria:
1. Default configuration disables all agent builtin tools (file editing, bash, etc.)
2. Developer can explicitly opt-in to allow specific builtin tools when needed
3. Claude Code and Codex CLI flags are audited and applied for forced tool use
4. Agent execution is sandboxed to session temp directory by default
5. When provided only MCP tools, agent cannot access host filesystem

---

### Phase 5: Observability Infrastructure

**Goal:** Extraction workflow is fully traceable with version awareness
**Depends on:** Phase 4
**Requirements:** OBSV-01, OBSV-02
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-01-PLAN.md — Instrument ExtractionOrchestrator with structured tracing spans and events at every extraction stage
- [x] 05-02-PLAN.md — CLI version detection and validation with semver parsing and structured warnings

**Details:**
Success Criteria:
1. Structured tracing logs every extraction stage (prompt sent, agent response, validation result, retry decisions)
2. CLI tool versions are detected and validated at startup
3. Clear warnings are shown when CLI tool version is unsupported
4. Trace output enables debugging retry loops and agent behavior

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:**
- Phase 2.1: Transparent MCP Tool Agent (inserted after Phase 2 for essential infrastructure)

**Key Decisions:**

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Force structured output via MCP tools rather than prompt-only | MCP tools give schema enforcement at the protocol level, not just hope the agent complies | ✓ Good |
| Three-tool pattern (submit/validate/example) | Gives agent a workflow: see example, validate draft, submit final — reduces invalid submissions | ✓ Good |
| Adapter-per-CLI crate structure | Clean separation of concerns, each CLI has different flags/behavior | ✓ Good |
| Best-effort containment per CLI | Each CLI has different sandbox mechanisms; document limitations rather than refuse to support | ✓ Good |
| Codex/OpenCode: prepend system prompt to user prompt (no --system-prompt flag) | E2E testing revealed flag doesn't exist in either CLI | Applied |
| Adapter-specific MCP config delivery (file vs -c overrides vs env var) | Each CLI has fundamentally different config mechanisms | Applied |
| Two execution paths: agent() vs mcp_agent() | Direct CLI for simple prompts, MCP-enforced for structured extraction | ✓ Good |

**Issues Resolved:**
- Stream race conditions (Phase 1)
- Panicking on stream failures (Phase 1)
- Silent JSON parsing failures (Phase 2)
- Unbounded channels (Phase 1)
- No retry logic (Phase 2)
- Windows compilation (Phase 6)
- Dead code warnings (Phase 7)

**Issues Deferred to v2:**
- Circuit breaker pattern (ADVF-01)
- Composable retry policies (ADVF-02)
- Session TTL and LRU eviction (ADVF-03)
- Prometheus metrics export (ADVF-04)
- Streaming extraction progress (ADVF-05)
- Mock test harness for CI (ADVF-06)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- opencode-adapter graceful_shutdown uses eprintln! instead of error propagation
- codex/opencode adapters don't call child.wait() after kill in timeout path (brief zombie)
- error_handling.rs doc comment mentions "retry exhaustion" but example shows timeout/fallback
